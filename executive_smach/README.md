Hybrid Buildsystem
------------------
Note that this is a _hybrid_ rosbuild-catkin repository. This means can clone
this repository into either a rosbuild-based environment or a catkin-based
environment. If you run "make" inside of one of the pacakges, it will attempt
to use rosbuild. If you place any of these packages into a catkin source
directory, it will work like a normal catkin package.
